            <p>My journey into Product Management didn't start with a traditional path. It started in <strong>Support</strong> at <strong>D·engage</strong>, where I discovered something powerful: the ability to truly understand what users need.</p>
            
            <h3>The View from the Frontlines</h3>
            <p>When you're in support, you're the first line of defense. You hear the frustration in a client's voice when a feature doesn't work as expected. You see the gap between what we built and what they actually need. I wasn't just marketing a product or closing tickets—I was helping businesses unlock the true value of our software.</p>
            
            <p>I found myself solving <strong>technical difficulties</strong> that were blocking their success. But more importantly, I started asking "Why?" Why are they struggling with this specific flow? Why did we build it this way? How can we solve this at the source?</p>
            
            <h3>From Problem-Solver to Problem-Preventer</h3>
            <p>This curiosity led me to bridge the gap between our clients and our engineering team. I started translating user pain points into technical requirements. I wasn't just reporting bugs—I was advocating for solutions that would prevent those problems from happening in the first place.</p>
            
            <p>That's when I realized: I wanted to be a Product Manager. I wanted to ensure we weren't just building <em>things</em>, but building the <em>right things</em>.</p>
            
            <h3>The Superpower of Empathy</h3>
            <p>My background in support gave me something invaluable: <strong>empathy</strong>. I know what it feels like when a product fails a user. I understand the domino effect one poorly designed feature can have on an entire business. And that understanding drives me to build products that don't just look impressive—they actually solve real problems.</p>
            
            <blockquote>"I leverage AI tools daily to learn faster, prototype quicker, and ship products that actually solve problems, not just look pretty."</blockquote>
            
            <p>Now, I'm on a journey to build and deliver products that are not only technologically advanced but also deeply user-centric and valuable to the people who use them every day.</p>
