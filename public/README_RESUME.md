# Resume PDF Instructions

## Where to Place Your Resume

To use the document viewer feature, you need to add your resume PDF:

1. **Place your resume file** in the `/public` folder
2. **Name it**: `resume.pdf`
3. **Path should be**: `/Users/a917751/Desktop/MyWork/public/resume.pdf`

## Current Status

The document viewer is fully implemented and ready to use. It just needs your actual resume PDF file.

## Alternative

If you don't have a resume.pdf yet, you can:
1. Create a sample PDF for testing
2. Or update the `resumeUrl` in `Hero.jsx` to point to an existing PDF URL online

## File Location

Update this line in `Hero.jsx` if needed:
```javascript
const resumeUrl = '/resume.pdf'; // Change this path if your resume is named differently
```
